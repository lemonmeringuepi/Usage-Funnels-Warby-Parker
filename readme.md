## Introduction

This project analyzes data across four tables:

- home_try_on
- purchase
- survey
- quiz

SQL queries are used to answer the following questions:

- What was the retention rate of users throughout the Style Quiz?
- What were the most and least common answers to each question in the Style Quiz?
- What does the usage funnel look like from taking the style quiz through purchase?
- Are users more likely to make a purchase after participating in a home try on program with three frames or five?
- What styles of frames are most likely to be purchased? What actionable data can be found?

## Technologies

* SQL
* Prezi

## Presentation

The SQL queries, as well as screenshots of the resulting tables, can be found as attachments to this repository. [Click here to be redirected to the full, interactive presentation of data on Prezi.](https://prezi.com/i/mvfks6qpphog/) Below is a sample image without interactivity:

## Sources

This project can be found on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)'s SQL course. The dataframe was generously made available by [Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com/).

I used [Prezi](https://www.prezi.com) to create and host the interactive infographic with my findings.
